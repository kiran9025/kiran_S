# Problem 1 – Simple Calculator
===

##  Objective
A simple terminal-based calculator built in Java that performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** based on user input.

---

## ️ How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to select an operation:
    - `addition`
    - `subtraction`
    - `multiplication`
    - `division`
2. The user enters two numbers of type double
3. The selected operation is performed, and the result is displayed.
   selected operation is performed, and the result is displayed.

# Problem 2 – Odd Number Series
===

## Objective
A simple Java program that prints the first **x odd numbers** starting from 1, based on user input.

---

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter how many numbers in the series should be printed.
2. It starts from 1 and keeps running series until specified times.
3. Prints the odd numbers in a single line separated by spaces.

# Problem 3 – Odd Number Series
===

## Objective
A Java program that prints a series of **odd numbers** starting from 1, adjusting the count so it always ends on an odd index.

---

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter how many numbers in the series should be printed.
2. If the input is an even number, it is reduced by 1 so the series count is odd.
3. It starts from 1 and keeps running series until specified times.
4. Prints the odd numbers in a single line separated by spaces.

# Problem 4 – Count Multiples in an array
===

## Objective
A Java program that counts how many numbers in a given list are multiples of each integer from **1 to 9**.

---

## How It Works
1. The user enters the length of the array.
2. The user inputs the list of integers.
3. For each number from 1 to 9, the program:
    - Checks how many elements in the list are divisible by it.
    - Stores the result in a `HashMap` where the key is the number (1–9) and the value is the count.
4. The program prints the `HashMap` showing the count of multiples for each number.
